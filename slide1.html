          <p style="text-align:center;">Abstract— This paper makes an insight into the connection between the human and informatics with the aim of acquiring a thought capable of responding to the current needs in the world by demonstrating the link between informatics and health. By doing so, a practical case of the use of information in agriculture and e-commerce on a case study is analyzed. Connecting the same to health making a research to find possibilities to solve the dry eye disorder using for example accurate natural vegetable solutions. Furthermore, simulating nature swarm algorithm in a computer. The results reveal potential algorithm knowledge for new perspectives and concerns in structured form aiding for instance information, daily practices, software development or world sustainability. The research makes a investigation of an optimized form of automation in an ecological balanced way. An argumentative discussion is also held, coming to the conclusion that ecological thought is ambitious since it gives the focus on biological solutions to informatics and that leads to question further forms of algorithmic optimized efficiency in the ecosphere with hope for a better understanding of nature.
